# Seq2Seq-Chatbot

This is our final project for CSE691 MIDL. We build a simple seq2seq chatbot based on tensorflow 2, using the cornell movie dialog corpus. Our code is basically refered to the keras example and the tensorflow tutorial. 

## Run the data
- Run 'datapreprocessing'
- Run 'gru_training_model' 
- Run 'bot_gru'

## File Problems
If you run the codes in local jupyter notebook, you may get folder error.
You need to update the file location, like r'C:\Users\Xin\Downloads\2020Spring\DeepLearning\Project\Apr26-simple-seq2seq-chatbot-master\simple-seq2seq-chatbot-master\cornell movie dialogs\movie_lines.txt' and add r before the files.
